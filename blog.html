						<h4>Website Version 2</h4>
						<p>This is the second iteration of the second iteration of the Spacesim website. Being worked on by a team of 3 contributing Spacesim members at present (though, please, don't hesitate to help out), the taskforce is aiming to modernize the look and feel of Spacesim, allowing us to come across as more professional to potential groups or sponsors.</p>
